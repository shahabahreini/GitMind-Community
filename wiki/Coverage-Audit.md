# GitMind 6.1.2 Documentation Coverage Audit

> Verified against GitMind `6.1.2` on September 3, 2026.

This page records the public surface checked during the GitMind 6.1.2 Wiki refresh. `node scripts/validate-wiki.mjs` compares the Wiki with `package.json` and fails when a public setting is undocumented.

## User-Facing Settings

- Model Settings: provider selection, all 22 built-in provider key/model/endpoint fields, Custom API, model loading, API checks, and rate-limit checks.
- Free Features: verbose output, Capture All Changes, custom context/saved prompt behavior, diagnostics, onboarding, debug, and telemetry.
- Commit Styles: all 12 styles and all Emoji Enhancement settings.
- Pro Features: encryption, target language, summary/body limits, advanced model parameters, Automatic Recovery, history learning, and changelog settings.
- Pro Activation: license-key activation, order verification, validation/status refresh, customer portal, deactivation, device slots, and troubleshooting.

Automatically managed values such as the saved last prompt, validation timestamps/status, instance IDs, and subscription state are documented as behavior but are not presented as user-editable settings. Developer-only environment and telemetry transport configuration is intentionally excluded.
