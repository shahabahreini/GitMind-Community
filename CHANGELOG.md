## v6.0.0 - 2026-07-14

### Commit Intelligence

- Added an explicitly opt-in reviewed commit workspace with optional intent, issue/branch context, notes, reversible context selection, local noise classification, secret screening, and inline provider/model/host/token disclosure. Existing one-click generation remains the default.
- Added automatic, concise, and detailed output modes; deterministic policy validation and separately confirmed repair; and exact insertion of only a valid user-approved draft into the selected repository's SCM input.
- Added versioned `.gitmind/commit-policy.json` rules and safe static commitlint JSON import without executing JavaScript configuration.
- Added interactive QuickPick candidate selection (`gitmind.draftChoices`) with live multiline preview in the top placeholder bar, displaying complete candidate subject and body text as the user navigates choices with arrow keys.
- Prompted AI candidate engine to generate three distinct archetypes: Candidate 1 (Concise 1-liner), Candidate 2 (Detailed breakdown), and Candidate 3 (Intent-focused summary).
- Overhauled the Reviewed Commit Workspace into a guided 3-step dashboard with branch pill badges, vector stroke SVG line icons, file line diff stats (`+24/-10`), noise classification indicators, and bulk context action buttons (`Include All`, `Summarize All`, `Exclude All`).
- Added real-time Commit Health Score visual gauge meter (0–100) with line-item conventional compliance status checks.
- Added dedicated Pre-Commit Code Review Panel rendering findings with color-coded severity tags (`ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`), details, and impacted file atom links when `review.enabled` is active.
- Added global colon sanitization across all 16 AI providers, prompt envelopes, and response processors, ensuring prefix formatting never creates double colons like `feat(commit)::`.
- Added Commit Intelligence status indicator (`Intelligence: Active / Off`) to the top settings configuration banner.
- Redesigned Changelog Statistics and Git History Statistics popups with metric KPI cards, rating badges, vector line icons, and zero emojis.

### Safety And Compatibility

- Replaced shell-interpolated Git paths with argument-based process execution and treated repository/user context as delimited untrusted data.
- Preserved all 18 providers, 12 commit styles, existing command aliases, licensing, settings, changelog, recovery, multi-repository SCM targeting, and sanitized support workflows.
- Eliminated extension-host disposable-leak warnings during clean test shutdown.

### Privacy

- Removed all GitMind product telemetry, analytics settings, Application Insights runtime dependencies, and deployment assets.
- Added automatic cleanup for retired telemetry settings and locally persisted telemetry state.
- Removed the production raw-debug setting and command; development builds retain local developer logging only.
- Added Pro-only, local sanitized support sessions with a strict allowlist, privacy validation, explicit review, and manual file sharing.

### Fixed

- Reworked Automatic Recovery so normal HTTP 429/model-limit failures can use the configured fallback, while account/billing quota failures remain excluded.
- Applied the same bounded recovery behavior to normal generation, custom prompts, commit-history learning, changelog generation, and large-diff chunk/merge requests.
- Normalized provider errors into meaningful user-safe categories without exposing raw response bodies or credentials.

### Changed

- Centralized provider defaults and curated model choices, refreshed current OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Cohere, MiniMax, Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and xAI integrations, and corrected xAI model discovery.
